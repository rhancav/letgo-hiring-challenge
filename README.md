## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running on your system.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the letgo-hiring-challenge.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to containerize the project and its required services. To start the
application, use the following Docker Compose commands:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/rhancav/letgo-hiring-challenge.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```cd letgo-hiring-challenge```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```docker-compose up -d```
4. The application and MongoDB will be started in separate containers. You can access the
   application at `http://localhost:8080`.

5. To stop the containers when you're done, use the following command:

   ```docker-compose down```

## API Endpoints

The Library REST API provides the following endpoints:

- **Books**
- `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books(Admins-Users).
- `GET /api/books/{bookName}`: Retrieve all books by name (Admins-Users).
- `GET /api/books/author/{name}`: Retrieve all books by author name (Admins-Users).
- `POST /api/books`: Create a new book (Admins).
- `PUT /api/books`: Update a book (Admins).
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book by ID (Admins).
- `GET /api/books/{bookId}/reviews`: Retrieve all reviews by book ID (Admins-Users).
- `POST /api/books/reviews`: Create a new review for a book (Admins-Users).
- **Swagger UI**
- `/api/swagger-ui/index.html`

## Usage

You can use tools like Postman, cURL, or any REST client to interact with the API. Make sure to set
appropriate headers and permissions for admin and user actions.

- Admin users should have the necessary privileges to access admin-specific endpoints.
- Normal users can access user-specific endpoints to create reviews and retrieve book data.
